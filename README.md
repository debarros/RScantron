# RScantron
**R code for logging into the Scantron Achievement Series website** 

**Paul de Barros, Schenectady, NY, USA**

### Structure:

* ui.R and server.R should contain as little as possible
* All functions should be stored in separate files to make it easier to implement improvements

### Current thing to work on:
* The `ScoreUpdates` function should download the class scores and responses csv's for each relevant section for any exam marked as reportable.  This is one step toward having it actually write the reports.  However, there are definitely more components that will need to be in place.  One is a correspondence of courses to exams.  Another is a way to programmatically handle special scoring.  
* Also, if there are rosters available, the list of reportable tests should be organized by priority of the report.  That way, the tests that are least likely to require a redo of the report are the ones that get done first.
    * First, they should be organized by date of scanning, with the ones that have the earliest _new_ scores first.  
    * Exams should be ordered (descending) by percentage of relevant sections that have at least one score.  
    * Within each of those groupings, the exams should be ordered (descending) by percentage of relevant students who have scores.  


### Naming conventions:

* functions:
    * PascalCase
    * format should be FindX, where X = what comes out
    * When there is a subfunction that is called using one row at a time from a data.frame, use a 1 in the function name
* data frames:
    * Use PascalCase
    * end name of object with "Frame"
* variables:
    * use bactrianCase
    * if the variable is a row from a data.frame, replace Frame with Row in the name
    * if the variable is a value from a row from a data.frame, use the column name
* Scantron entities
    * Test = published test
    * Draft = draft test
    * Session = scheduled session
    * Student = student
    * Event = the event of a student taking a test
    * Score = student score on a test
    * TestFolder = published test folder
    * DraftFolder = draft test folder
    * SessionFolder = scheduled session folder
    * Class = a class section
    

### New Functions:

#### These functions are not yet written, but should be easy
* `FindClassAverages` get every class average for a test, or for all tests
  

#### These functions will be a little more complicated to produce
* `CreateReport` use RMarkDown to write a report, or just load data in a template
* `SendReport` send an email with the report attached
* `UpdateScoreMonitoring` load data into the score monitoring spreadsheets
* The `CreateReport` and `UpdateScoreMonitoring` functions will need to have templates defined using openxlsx.
  * When the test is set up, the score report can be saved into the folder and the scoring added manually.,
  * Later, the scoring formula format can be formalized, and the formula can be placed as a comment in the published test.
  * Note: the test description can only hold 50 characters.
    * The Session description space can hold up to 100 characters.  Still not enough.
    * The draft description can hold 50 characters.
    * The scan operator instructions for a scheduled test can hold lots of characters, 
    * but there doesn't seem to be a way to access that data.


#### These functions will require integration with ExamView
* `CopyDraft` save a local copy of an ako draft in some simple format
* `MakeLocalDraft` convert some simple format into ExamView form


#### These functions rely on the idea of creating a local mirror of all data
* `BuildMirror` Create a local copy of all data
* `StoreMirror` save that copy
* `LoadMirror` load it from memory
* `CompareMirror` Compare the current state to a former state 
* The `CompareMirror` function should generate a To Do list of Score Reports and Score Updates.
* The `StoreMirror` function should update the score monitoring spreadsheet


## More stuff

* Make it into a package
* What about changing the settings in the account so that it doesnâ€™t display everything?  Then, it could use the link to access another page if it needed to.  This would have the advantage of being able to stop loading student testing events once it hit a particular date.  Not sure if this would result in improved return time.  Maybe this could be explored with some benchmarking?
* How can we make the UpdateTab function also get the local folder?
	* What if it launched a Select File window, and you had to select the test setup file?  It could then determine the local folder from that, and also add the test setup file name to the TAB
* Determine the draft location and add it to the test setup file
	* See the Load draft locations.R file.  It is incomplete as yet.
* Redo the custom sectioning system in the TAB to have 2 columns - method and parameter
	* Method can be List, Teacher, Teacher+Course, or Query
	* Parameter is usually a semicolon delimited list
	* If Method is Teacher, match all sections with the teachers named in the Parameter column
	* If Method is List, match all sections with section numbers named in the Parameter column
	* If Method is Teacher+Course, match all sections of the relevant course with teachers named in the Parameter column
	* If Method is Query, match sections based on the SQL query in the Parameter column
* Add to the TAB a sheet with section performance for score monitoring.
	* Each time a report is generated, add or replace a row for each section and each comparison group that has an overall score
	* Each row should include the test name, section name, and score
	* Later, this will be used to dynamically generate the score monitoring graphs
	* This should probably be accomplished with a new package call rrttMonitoring or something like that.
